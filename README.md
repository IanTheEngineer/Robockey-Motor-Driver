Robockey-MotorDriver
=========================

This is very simple 4-motor driver that I designed years ago for my team's Robockey Robots.

Input a +9V power supply. This board supplies that voltage straight to the motors. 

There is also a +5V voltage regulator onboard, for the logical operations of the H-Bridges. This +5V is available via connector to power external boards.

Enjoy!
