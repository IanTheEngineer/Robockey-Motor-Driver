Robockey-Motor-Controller
=========================

This is very simple 4-motor driver that I designed years ago for my team's Robockey Robots.

Input a +9V power supply. This board supplies that voltage straight to the motors. 

Additionally, there is a +5V voltage regulator onboard, for the logical operations of the H-Bridges. There is also a connector to supply this 5V externally.

Enjoy!
